# Anomaly Detection For Electrical Systems


Anomaly detection with Industrial PC-based energy measurement framework
The technical basis is a BECKHOFF Industrial PC running a TwinCAT 3 SoftPLC and using some measurement I/O modules that are able to deliver high-frequency measurements. Voltages and currents shall be measured from several measurement objects, such as different machines, electrical servo drives or other electrical consumers, preferably non-linear consumers. From these measurements, the consumed energy shall be calculated in real-time.
As a second step, using the measurements, the TwinCAT Analytics library shall be applied to extract or recognize particular features/patterns/characteristics that can easily be transmitted to a remote surveillance application.
In a further step, selected machines or applications should be modelled according to their energy consumption profile. These models should be trainable based on the measurements and used to observe abnormal operations.
